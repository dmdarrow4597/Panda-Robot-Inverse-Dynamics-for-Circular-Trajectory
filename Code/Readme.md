a. File organization of Homework 5
	1. darshit_hw5_report.pdf: Main assignment file-contains derivations of both questions and assumptions taken. Recommended to refer 
	   first before inspecting the code and plots
	2. Code files (Folder, Python notebooks and scripts): Note this folder contains .ipynb files.
		|_darshit_code.ipynb (Code)
			|_darshit_code.ipynb:(Python notebook script file containing code): Contains derivation of Jacobian Matrix, and 
			iterative loop for FK, IK and Inverse Dynamics of robot end effector pose; 
			Note some matrices are too large to attach in report refer this code's output for proper display
	3. Readme
	4. Results folder (Contains images of 2d Y-Z Plot, 3d X-Y-Z Plot for end effector, torque vs iteration plots)
	
b. Code running instructions:

	Question 1:
		Refer derivations and hand calculations done in the report before referring the code files. Run all cells before running the 
		integration while loop
		For darshit_code.ipynb file:
			Step 1: Open Terminal, Navigate to the location where the file is stored
			Step 2: Run the python file in Jupyter notebook darshit_code.ipynb or by pressing Run all in Vscode
			Step 3: The code will show the result equations for reference
c. References:
	a. Lecture 8 and Lecture 9 pdf files
	b. Sympy documentation
	c. Matplotlib documentation
	d. Center of Gravity values taken from this paper- https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02265294/document
